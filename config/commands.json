      "name": "Set the focus and stakes",
      "prompt": "Ask a question that clarifies what the user wants to explore, why it matters to them right now, and what prompted this line of thinking.",

      "name": "Articulate the perceived structure",
      "prompt": "Ask a question that invites the user to describe the forces, patterns, or underlying structures they believe are shaping the situation right now—surfacing their current mental model of how this dynamic works, without requiring a conclusion, judgment, or defended claim."

      "name": "Pressure-test assumptions",
      "prompt": "Ask a single, open-ended question that confronts the user with the most self-serving, identity-protective, or convenient assumption underlying their claim, explicitly naming the bias or reasoning shortcut at work and asking what concrete evidence, counterexample, or lived experience would genuinely force them to revise or abandon their current framing."

      "number": 6,
      "name": "Reveal emotional stakes",
      "prompt": "Ask a question that forces the user to reflect on what they are emotionally protecting or afraid to lose if their claim is true, in a way that invites personal reflection rather than a short or factual answer."

      "number": 7,
      "name": "Expose the friction",
      "prompt": "Ask a question that forces the user to reflect on where their claim clashes with another value, goal, or self-image they care about, and what that tension feels like for them."

    },
    {
      "number": 9,
      "name": "Consider implications",
      "prompt": "Ask a question that pushes the user to consider the downstream implications or second-order effects of their claim if it were widely acted on or turned into a rule."
